Hi! MyBay is a cross-platform local Pirate Bay "website".

It can search the most recent known Pirate Bay dump (magnet link below)

To use it, follow these steps:

1) Download the project (click the ZIP button above)

2) Unzip the project somewhere

3) Download the archive. Magnet link:
   magnet:?xt=urn:btih:B3BCB8BD8B20DEC7A30FD9EC43CE7AFAAF631E06

4) Unzip the archive to the same folder as this file. You should see a file
   called "torrents_mini.csv". MYBAY WON'T WORK WITHOUT THIS FILE.

5) Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed. If you have a Mac or Linux it
   should already be there.

6) Run the MyBay script (mybay.command on a Mac or mybay.cmd on Windows).

7) After the app is opened, type something in the search and wait for the
   results to appear in your favourite browser. It can take some time for them
   to appear, as the dump file is really large.

Have fun!
